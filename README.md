Tic-tac-toe project for The Odin Project Fullstack Javascript course. 

Spent the last lesson learning about modules and factory functions and will be using these to construct the objects which will be used in the game. The aim is to use as little global code as possible and to have things tucked away in their place.
Still feeling very shaky about these new concepts. It has been a lot of learning over not a lot of time so I expect this may take a while and lots of going back and revising the course notes.
